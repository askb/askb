## 🚀 About Me

Senior IT Engineer at **The Linux Foundation**, specializing in release engineering, cloud infrastructure automation, and developer tooling. I architect and maintain CI/CD pipelines that power some of the largest open source projects, focusing on scalability, reliability, and intelligent automation.

Currently exploring **AI/ML integration** in DevOps workflows—building intelligent tooling, experimenting with LLM-assisted development, and finding ways to make infrastructure smarter and more autonomous.

When I'm not optimizing build systems or experimenting with AI, you'll find me on two wheels (🚴 bicycle or 🏍️ motorcycle) or exploring trails on foot 🥾.

### 🔧 Core Competencies

- **Infrastructure Engineering** - Cloud platforms, container orchestration, distributed systems
- **Release & Deployment Automation** - CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, deployment strategies
- **Developer Experience** - CLI tools, APIs, workflow optimization, productivity automation
- **AI-Assisted Development** - LLM integration, intelligent tooling, automated workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Declarative automation, configuration management, immutable infrastructure
